# bench-fsharp-template
A simple template for an F# benchmark using BenchmarkDotNet and Diagnostics.Windows

## Why?

Because each time I attempt to write a quick little benchmark, I end up screwing around for 1/2 an hour fiddling with nuget and other things that aren't very important.

This template let's me clone, modify `bench.fsx` slightly, then `run` with no fuss.
